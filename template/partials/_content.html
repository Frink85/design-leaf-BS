            <ul>
                <li><b>Augur array : </b>Once per battle, in the Shooting phase, you can
                    re-roll a single failed hit roll for a vehicle with
                    an augur array.
                </li>
                <li><b>Dozer blade : </b>If a vehicle with a dozer blade charges in the
                    Charge phase, add 1 to all hit rolls made for it
                    until the end of the ensuing Fight phase.
                </li>
                <li><b>Emergency Plasma Vents : </b>If this model fires a supercharged plasma cannon,
                    and you roll one or more hit rolls of 1, it is not
                    automatically destroyed. Instead, for each hit roll
                    of 1, the bearer suffers 1 mortal wound after all of
                    this weapon's shots have been resolved.
                </li>
                <li><b>Explodes (6+/6"/D3) : </b>If this model is reduced to 0 wounds, roll a D6
                    before removing it from the battlefield and before
                    any embarked models disembark. On a 6 it explodes,
                    and each unit within 6" suffers D3 mortal
                    wounds.
                </li>
                <li><b>Grinding Advance : </b>If this model remains stationary or moves under half
                    speed in its Movement phase (i.e. it moves a
                    distance in inches less than half of its current
                    Move characteristic) it can shoot its turret weapon
                    twice in the following Shooting phase (the turret
                    weapon must target the same unit both times).
                    Furthermore, hit rolls for this model&#8217;s turret
                    weapon do not suffer the penalty for moving and
                    shooting a Heavy weapon. The following weapons are
                    turret weapons: battle cannon, Conqueror battle
                    cannon, Demolisher cannon, Eradicator nova cannon,
                    Executioner plasma cannon, Exterminator autocannon,
                    Punisher gatling cannon, Stygies Vanquisher battle
                    cannon, twin lascannon and Vanquisher battle
                    cannon.
                </li>
                <li><b>Smoke Launchers : </b>Once per game, instead of shooting any weapons in
                    the Shooting phase, the vehicle can use its Smoke
                    Launchers; until your next Shooting phase your
                    opponent must subtract 1 from all hit rolls for
                    ranged weapons that target this vehicle.
                </li>
                <li><b>Track guards : </b>A vehicle with track guards always counts as having
                    its starting number of Wounds when determining its
                    Move characteristic (i.e., its Move characteristic
                    does not decrease as it suffers wounds).
                </li>
                <li><b>Vehicle Squadron : </b>The first time this unit is set up, all models in
                    this unit must be placed within 6" of each other.
                    From that point onwards, each operates independently
                    and is treated as a separate unit for all rules
                    purposes.
